American Experience is television’s most watched history series which has been 
producing films since 1988.   Like our other series, it offers a wealth of additional 
features on its website which debuted in 1995.  To date, American Experience Online 
has produced over 175 feature sites, enabling viewers to watch films online and 
encouraging in-depth exploration of each film beyond the television screen. 

American Experience’s original footage is available for licensing. However, note 
that more than any of our other series, American Experience contains a great deal 
of third party material, which has been licensed from other sources.
